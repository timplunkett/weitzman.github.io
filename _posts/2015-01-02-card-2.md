Founded a small consultancy which replatformed many sites onto Drupal including: 
- [The Economist](http://www.economist.com) 
- [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org) 
- [Examiner](http://wwww.examiner.com)

In the process, contributed the [Drupal Migrate framework](http://drupal.org/project/migrate) to the world. This tool is the accepted standard for migrating any content into Drupal. This tool has contributed significantly to Drupal's growth.
